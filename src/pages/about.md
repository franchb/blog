This is my personal blog.

I work as a lead software engineer in an enterprise project. At work I use Go programming language. Also, I'm involved in a devsecops stack where I use such things as k8s, podman, Fedora, SELinux, Gitlab/gitlab-runner/Jenkins, S3, PostgreSQL, Prometheus/Grafana/VictoriaMetrics.

In my free time I learn Rust and Zig.

This blog is build with NodeJS/Astro/Astro Blog theme.
