I am a software engineer now. In my past days I was a medical student and a balloon design company owner.

This site is a small home for my personal thoughts, notes on software engineering and programming languages.

Feel free to email me to [hello@franchb.com](mailto:hello@franchb.com).

Also, you could find me at Matrix [@franchb:franchb.com](https://matrix.to/#/@franchb:franchb.com)
