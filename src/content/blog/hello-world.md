Welcome to my blog!

Today is a good date to some extent, in the first days of March, a little magic sometimes appeared in my life.

I work as a lead software engineer in some enterprise company.

I like to think of my blog as a way to keep friends, colleagues, and family up-to-date on what I've been doing and thinking about. Also, I want to write about programming languages I know, security, biology, machine learning and other topics that are close to my interests or work.

Hope to convert my thoughts into something readable!
